<h1>ProjectEmployee </h1>
<p align = "justify"> is an evolving GitHub repository where I am actively implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to create a robust and organized employee management system. 
The ongoing development in "Project Employee" involves the creation of classes representing different employee types, each encapsulating their unique attributes and functionalities. By leveraging the power of OOP, this project not only provides a practical application of theoretical concepts but also serves as a reference for others looking to understand the implementation of OOP in real-world scenarios. </p>
<p align = "justify" >Collaborators and enthusiasts are invited to explore, contribute, and gain insights into effective OOP practices within the context of employee management through Project Employee. </p>
